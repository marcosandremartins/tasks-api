Purpose: convert API & UI findings into a concise, prioritized test plan.

Rules:

- Produce a small, actionable plan (P0 first). Keep scope minimal.
- Map each test to owner, priority, and file/area in repo.
- Include any relevant context, assumptions, and open questions for implementers.
- Dont write any code snippets in summary. Focus on planning, architecture, and task breakdown.

Deliverable (Handoff Packet):

- Create file `test-plan-<timestamp>.md` (prioritized P0/P1 list of tests) in the `.ai-outputs` directory and return the file path in the Handoff Packet.
- Inputs, assumptions, and any open questions for implementers
- Quick runbook: commands and env vars required to run the planned tests
