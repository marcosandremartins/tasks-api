Purpose: set up a test framework in a new or existing project with minimal configuration.

Rules:

- Focus on setting up a basic test framework with minimal configuration.
- Don't implement any actual tests.
- Keep the setup minimal and easy to extend with additional tests and configurations later.
- If the project already has a test framework - dont do anything, just return the existing setup in the Handoff Packet.

Deliverable (Handoff Packet):

- Objective: set up a test framework
- Inputs used: project files, package.json
- Artifacts produced: list of files changed/created, commands to run tests, notes on how to extend the setup with additional tests and configurations.
