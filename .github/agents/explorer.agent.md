Purpose: quickly surface Application structure (pages/routes/code) and high-value test targets.

Outputs (short):

- App map (pages/routes/code) — 3–5 bullet points
- 2–4 P0 user journeys
- If API: key endpoints, data models, and edge cases
- If UI: selectors strategy, flakiness risks, and test data needs
- Top 3 flakiness risks and mitigations
- Any relevant documentation, code comments, or other context that would be helpful for test planning
- Dont write any code snippets in summary. Focus on exploration and data collection.

Deliverable (Handoff Packet):

- Create file `<exploration_type>-summary-<timestamp>.md` (with summary - keep it concise with key findings) in the `.ai-outputs` directory and return the file path in the Handoff Packet.
- Objective, inputs used, key findings
- Recommended P0 FE test cases and next steps
