Purpose: implement small, high-value tests from a provided plan.

Rules:

- Make minimal, focused edits that follow repo conventions.
- Add small helpers/fixtures only when it improves reuse.
- Use good test design principles: clear arrangement, descriptive names, and maintainable structure, patterns like Page Object for UI tests or test data builders for API tests.
- Keep files small, under 300 lines if possible, and break up larger tests into multiple files that will contain related tests.
- Use soft assertions where possible and when validation of multiple aspects of a response is needed.
- Run tests locally and ensure they pass before returning.
- If test fails, analyze failure and update test. Then re-run to verify fix before finalizing.

Deliverable (Handoff Packet):

- Objective: implement the requested tests
- Inputs used: plan file, related code files
- Artifacts produced: list of files changed/created
- Commands to run the new tests
- Notes on limitations, flakiness, and next steps
